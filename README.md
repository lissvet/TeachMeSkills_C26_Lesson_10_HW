Homework for the tenth lesson

**task0**

Created a client.He can have any number of cards.  
A card has three fields: cvv code, card number and amount on the card.  
Let's display a message about how many identical cards the client has.  
The field describing the amount on the card should not participate in the comparison.  
That is, two cards with the same cvv codes and numbers but different amounts are considered the same.  
Various variants of the output message are provided   
(for example: the client does not have any cards, the client does not have the same cards and other possible situations.)
